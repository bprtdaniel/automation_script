# automation_script
This is a sample script to automate a hypothetical process on a hypothetical website, for hypothetical data people on hypothetical campaign teams. Hypothetically speaking.

It consists of 2 main scripts:

1. The pdfer helper function: This .py file constructs the main logic of the automation. It consists of selenium driver startup, page navigation and the base loop of the function.

2. Pdfer: This file is the script that can be manually executed to print iteratively with the loop.
